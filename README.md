# CI/CD

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD, or Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery, is a practice in DevOps that aims to improve software development and deployment processes, mainly by making them much faster.

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository. Each merge triggers an automated build and testing process, providing immediate feedback to the team. This enables us to identify bugs early and save time through automation.
